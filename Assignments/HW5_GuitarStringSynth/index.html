                                        Sound is the result of pressure waves traveling through the air.  Just as our ears pick up these pressure variations and send a signal to our brain, digital microphones/ADCs are designed to turn these variations <i>into an array of pressure samples</i> over time (<i>in the discussion below, we often refer to "sample" and "array index" interchangeably</i>).  Digital audio is often sampled at 44100 samples per second, which we refer to as the <b>sample rate (FS)</b>.  This means that if we want to represent 2 seconds of audio, for instance, we need an array with 88200 samples (good thing we're using arrays and don't have to define 88200 individual variables!). The reason for this is that we need a sampling frequency that's at least twice the highest frequency we want to represent.  Since the highest frequency humans can hear is around 20,000hz, 44100hz is adequate. (Another fun fact about this number is it is 2<SUP>2</SUP>  3<SUP>2</SUP> 5<SUP>2</SUP> 7<SUP>2</SUP>)
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Square Waves And Pitches</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        One property of our perception of audio is that if a sound repeats a pattern over and over again quickly enough, we hear it as a <b>pitch</b>, or musical note.  For example, let's consider a "square wave."  The code below is a snippet from <code>SquareWave.java</code> in the homework 5 package which generates this pattern.  The pattern will repeat itself every <code>T</code> elements in the array.  This is referred to as the <b>period</b> of the audio.

                                <HR><h3>Pure Tone Sinusoids</h3>
                                <p>
                                    It's also possible to build sounds from sine waves, which we refer to as "pure tones." Given a sample rate <code>FS</code>, a period <code>T</code>, and an <i>amplitude</i> (loudness) <code>a</code>, the formula for the value in the array at index <code>i</code> is

                                    <h3>
                                        \[ a \sin(2 \pi i / T) \]
                                    </h3>

                                    For those who know trigonometry, you'll notice that this does indeed go through one period over <code>T</code> samples, since that will bring it from 0 to 2 PI.  The code to do this, which can be found in <code>Sinusoid.java</code> in the homework 5 code, looks like this:

                                    The square waves and sinusoids sound a bit dull and unrealistic (although a real clarinet does sound a bit <a href = "https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/clarinet.html">like a square wave</a>). But it is possible to make a very realistic plucked guitar sound with a surprisingly simple algorithm known as the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis">Karplus-Strong Algorithm</a>, which is the starting point for <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_waveguide_synthesis">all of the digital synthesizers</a> used in the 80s and beyond.  Your job in this assignment will be to implement the Karplus-Strong algorithm in several stages by filling in three methods in <code>GuitarString.java</code>

                                    Most Western string orchestras tune to a "concert A," which goes through 440 periods in one second.  If our audio is sampled at 44100 samples per second, this means that each period takes up about 100 samples (which we saw in the examples above).  In each <i>octave</i> in the Western chromatic scale, there are 12 notes total.  Going from one note to its adjacent note in order is called a <i>halfstep</i>.  For example, a <b>B</b> is 2 halfsteps above <b>A</b>.  The formula for determining the period for a particular note <code>h</code> halfsteps away from a concert A is
                                </p>

                                    \[ T = \frac{FS}{440 \times 2^{h/12}} \]
                                </h3>

                                For example, at a sample rate of 44100, a B which is 2 halfsteps above concert A has a period of

                                <h3>
                                    \[ T = \frac{44100}{440 \times 2^{2/12}} \approx 89.29 \]
                                </h3>

                                Notice how the period has gotten shorter, which indeed corresponds to an increase in pitch, as we saw in the square/sinusoid examples.  
                                
                                <p>It is also possible for the halfstep to be negative, in which case the formula yields a period <i>longer</i> than 100, for a pitch lower than 440.  For example, for a G two halfsteps below concert A, the formula yields
                                </p>

                                    The next step of the algorithm consists of coming up with some "random noise," which sounds like static.  In the context of the Karplus Strong algorithm, this can be thought of as randomly stimulating the string with a pluck.  To do this, you will complete the method:

                                    By default, the main function in <code>GuitarString.java</code> plays the first 24 halfsteps in sequence, which is two octaves of the <i>chromatic scale</i>.  If your code is working properly and you run the main, you should hear the following sound

                                    As extra credit, you should fill in the method <code>playFile</code>, which loads in and plays a bunch of notes in sequence from a text file.  The text file contains a bunch of lines with comma separated values for <code>halfstep,duration,decay</code>.  For example, the file <a href = "HappyBirthday.txt"><code>HappyBirthday.txt</code></a> contains the following sequence of 25 notes

                                        If you have a String <code>s</code> of comma-separated values, then <code>s.split(",")</code> will return an array of Strings that are on either side of the commas.  For instance, <code>"11,12,13".split(",")</code> will return the array <code>{"11", "12", "13"}</code>.  You will then need to convert each to the correct type.  The function <code>Integer.parseInt(string)</code> will convert a string to an integer, and the function <code>Double.parseDouble(string)</code> will convert a string to a double.
