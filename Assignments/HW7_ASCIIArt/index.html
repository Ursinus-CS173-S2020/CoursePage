										<p>
                                            The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with 2D arrays in Java with a concrete, visual application.  Students will write a program to automatically generate "<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII Art</a>", which is text that approximates a given image.  An example is given above with the UC logo.  In this assignment, we will restrict ourselves to characters in the ASCII subset of UTF-8, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and some special characters; hence the name "ASCII Art" (<a href = "../HW6_PseudoRandomCrypto/index.html#bgunicode">Click here</a> to review the last assignment where we discussed ASCII/Unicode).  
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            As an optional part of this assignment, students may create a submission as part of an <a href = "#artcontest">art contest</a>.  Any submission whatsoever will receive 2 extra credit points, and the winner will receive 5 extra cedit points.
                                        </p>

                                    <h2><a name = "grayscale">Background: Grayscale Images And Text</a></h2>
                                    <p>
                                        As we discussed in our 2D arrays module, a 2D array is a natural data structure for image data, since an image is a two dimensional object with both an x and y coordinate for each pixel.  In this assignment, we will be dealing with <i>grayscale images</i>, in which each pixel goes from black (0) to white (1).  We usually treat the outer array index as a row (y coordinate) and the inner array index as a column (x coordinate).  For instance, let's run the following code, using the methods provided in the assignment

                                        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
                                            Picture picture = new Picture("HW7_ASCIIArt/Examples/ursinus.png");
                                            double[][] image = getGrayscaleArray(picture);
                                        ]]></script>  

                                        This code will load in the Ursinus image at the top of this page as a grayscale image.  The figure below shows an example of how to index three different pixels in this image, as well as their value in the array.  As you can see, pixels which are darker have a value closer to 0, and pixels which are lighter have a value closer to 1.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <img src = "HW7_ASCIIArt/Examples/Pixels.png">
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        To turn this into text, we observe that certain characters are "darker" than others if we squint our eyes; that is, certain characters require more ink than others to draw in the same area.  Our goal, therefore, will be to print out darker characters for darker images in the region, and lighter characters for lighter regions.  Let's consider using all of the character below, for example:
                                    </p>


                                    
                                    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
                                        @#BW8gMN6&9RQqE0d$DbpmOa5AH2GZeKPS3X4U%kwohFVyzIsCu{xfn}tJTi17c=jYL?l[]v<>+|)r(/\*_!;^~":,-'.`
                                    ]]></script>  

                                    <p>
                                        In fact, this is the constant string <code>GRAYSCALE_CHARS</code> defined at the top of the provided code.  If you look closely, you will see that these characters have been sorted roughly in order from darkest to lightest.  Assuming you're using the default font in Netbeans's console, the image below shows these characters blown up, along with the percentage of the canvas taken up by their ink
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <img src = "HW7_ASCIIArt/GrayscaleDict/sorted.png" width=500 height=500>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        A constant array called <code>GRAYSCALE_VALUES</code> has also been provided, which is parallel to the array <code>GRAYSCALE_CHARS</code>, and which holds a 0 for the darkest one and a 1 for the lightest one.  For instance

                                        <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
                                            System.out.print(GRAYSCALE_CHARS.charAt(2) + " ");
                                            System.out.print(GRAYSCALE_VALUES[2]);
                                        ]]></script>  

                                        prints out <code>B 0.08205</code>.  This indicates that a <b>B</b> is a darker character, with a grayscale value of only about <b>0.08</b>.

                                    </p>

                                    <h2><a name = "averaging">Background: Rectangular averaging</a></h2>

                                    <p>
                                        At this point, we could simply print out a row of text for each row in the grayscale image, and print out the character at the index of <code>GRAYSCALE_VALUES</code> with the closest grayscale value.  However, not only would this print out way too many characters, but the characters are only printed out half as wide as they are tall, so this would end up printing out an image that's stretched out by a factor of 2 vertically (the "aspect ratio" would be wrong).  To address both of these problems, we can output a single character per <b>block</b> of pixels.  In particular, we can average all of the grayscale values in a rectangular block that's twice as tall as it is wide, and print out a single character for this block.  To see an example, let's consider taking a block that's 8 pixels tall and 4 pixels wide in different parts of an image of an Ursinus flag.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If we take a block in a bright region, the average grayscale is very high, so it ends up getting a single quote, which has very little ink.
                                        
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src = "HW7_ASCIIArt/Examples/Flag_24_48.png">
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If we take a dark region in the tree, the average is quite low, and it gets an uppercase <b>B</b>, which is one of the characters that uses the most ink.
                                        
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <img src = "HW7_ASCIIArt/Examples/Flag_48_24.png">
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        If we take a block that's one one of the bricks, it's somewhere in between, so the average is about middle gray, which ends up getting a lowercase <b>c</b>, which uses a medium amount of ink
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        <img src = "HW7_ASCIIArt/Examples/Flag_280_32.png">

                                        When you do this, you should take all non-overlapping blocks in the image that you can.  So, for instance, the above image is <code>466x466</code> pixels.  This means that if we use a block that's 8 tall and 4 wide, we can fit 59 blocks from top to bottom and 117 blocks from left to right.  For instance, the block that started at row 28 and column 32 in the above image is 35 rows down and 8 columns over.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Be careful not to run out of bounds when taking pixels in a block</b>.  The rightmost and bottommost blocks won't actually have 8x4 pixels in them, because you'll run out of space.
                                    </p>

                                                In the Horstmann book, example 6.3.2 is a helpful reference for finding averages, and example 6.3.3 is a helpful example for finding the closest value to another value when you're converting from brightness to a character.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                You'll have to come up with your own way of organizing the code, but it may be a good idea to make a separate method to compute the average grayscale value in a block, and to call this method within a loop that loops through all blocks.  You may also want to make a method that finds the character that's closest to a particular grayscale value.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                As usual, a part of your grade will be on style.  So, among other things, be sure you're naming your variables and methods appropriately.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Be careful not to go out of bounds when extracting blocks.  Blocks at the edges may be smaller than other blocks since you'll run out of space.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                When you look at the text printed to the console, you will probably have to make the font size very small to see the full picture.  <code>CTRL DOWN</code> makes the console text smaller and <code>CTRL UP</code> makes the text larger
