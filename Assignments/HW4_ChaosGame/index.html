                                    <p>
                                        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Fractals</a> are beautiful mathematical shapes which are <i>self-similar</i>, which means they are made up of smaller parts of themselves.  Many shapes in nature are approximately fractals.  Take a <a href = "barnsley.html">fern</a>, for example.  As shown below, it's possible to make a fern out of smaller ferns which are rotated, translated (moved), and scaled, but which are otherwise exactly the same.  And those smaller ferns, in turn, are made up of even smaller versions of the exact same fern:
                                    </p>
                                    <img src = "fern.png">
                                    <p>
                                        In this assignment, you will be making other types of fractals by simulating a probabilistic game known as <b>the chaos game</b>.  This game consists of choosing some points on a polygon, and then drawing a bunch more points on the inside of that polygon by following a bunch of random steps.  As such, it is a great assignment for exploring loops.

                                    <h3>StdDraw Library</h3>
                                        We will be using the StdDraw library from the <a href = "https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/">Princeton Algorithms 4 CS library</a> to help us draw points. <a href = "https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html">Click here</a> to see more documentation on the StdDraw library.  I have provided an example program that uses StdDraw in <code>LineSegments.java</code>.  We also filled in the program <code>RandomCircle.java</code> in class.  Make sure you understand these programs before you continue.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2><a name = "sierpinski">Part 1: Sierpinski Triangle (10 Points)</a></h2>
                                    <p>
                                        The first fractal you will make is called the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski Triangle</a>.  You will start with three points on the 2D Cartesian plane that form a triangle.  These are parameters that you will send into a void method which does the drawing.  Each point has both an x and a y coordinate, so the points are
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>a</b> = (ax, ay)</li>
                                            <li><b>b</b> = (bx, by)</li>
                                            <li><b>c</b> = (cx, cy)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Given these three initial points, an algorithm to randomly draw points on the Sierpinski Triangle is as follows:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>First, draw the point <b>a</b>, and designate this as the last point drawn</li>
                                            <li>Randomly choose a point that's either <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, or <b>c</b>.  Draw a point halfway in between the last point drawn and this randomly chosen point</li>
                                            <li>Repeat step 2 for until the chosen number of samples has been drawn.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        The point halfway in between a point <b>p</b> with coordinates (px, py) and a point <b>q</b> with coordinates (qx, qy) can be computed by averaging the coordinates of the two points.  That is, the x-coordinate of the halfway point is (px + qx)/2, and the y-coordinate of the halfway point is (py + qy)/2.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Numerical Example</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        As an example, consider the triangle with points <b>a</b> = (0, 0), <b>b</b> = (1, 0), and <b>c</b> = (1, 1).  Here are the points we draw
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>As always, we first draw <b>a</b></li>
                                            <li>Let's say the next randomly chosen point is <b>c</b>.  We'd draw our second point halfway in between <b>a</b> and <b>c</b>, which is at (0.5, 0.5).</li>
                                            <li>Let's then say the next point chosen is <b>b</b>.  We'd draw the third point halfway in between (0.5, 0.5) and <b>b</b> = (1, 0), which is at (0.75, 0.25).</li>
                                            <li>Let's then say the next point chosen is <b>c</b> again.    We'd then draw the fourth point halfway in between (0.75, 0.25) and <b>c</b> = (1, 1), which is (0.875, 0.625)</li>.  
                                        </ol>
                                        The animation below shows these steps visually

                                    You should fill in the method 

                                    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
                                        void drawTriangleChaos(double ax, double ay, double bx, double by, double cx, double cy, int nPoints)

                                    This method takes in the x and y coordinates of 3 points on the triangle, as well as the number of points we aim to draw.  Note that if you're generated a random object called <code>rand</code> (which has been provided to you in <code>Triangle.java</code>), then the code

                                    will generate a random integer between 0 and 2, which you can use to help choose the next point.

                                    </ul>


                                </div>

                                <h2><a name = "extracredit">Extra Credit (+3 Points)</a></h2>

                                <p>
                                    Create another version of the quadrilateral example.  Assuming the points a, b, c, d are specified in either clockwise or counterclockwise order, choose your next point so that it is <b>not two away from the previous point chosen</b>; that is, you should always be traveling to the next or previous point specified; so, for example <b>a</b> goes to <b>d</b> or <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> goes to <b>b</b> or <b>d</b>.  If this works properly, you should see a fractal like the one below:
                                </p>
