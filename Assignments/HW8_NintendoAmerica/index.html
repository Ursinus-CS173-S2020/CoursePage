										<p>
                                            This is the final assignment in this spring's CS 173 class, and it will serve as a segue into CS 174.  The purpose of this assignment is to get you practice with classes, objects, and some of the basic data structures we talked about in the most recent modules: namely <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>HashMap</code>.   In particular, you will be extracting information from a collection of about 2000 tweets from the <a href = "https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica">Nintendo America</a> twitter account between October 2018 and this month.
                                        </p>

                                                    Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (<i>I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard</i>)
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Any other concerns that you have. For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here. The more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (fine to leave this blank)
                                                </li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </p>

                                    <h2><a name = "tostring">Part 1: The <code>Tweet</code> object and <code>toString() </code> (5 Points)</a></h2>

                                    <p>
                                        At this point, you should familiarize yourself with the <code>Tweet</code> class.  A static method  <code>getAllTweets</code> has been provided to load in all of the tweets into an array.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    In the first task, you should create a <code>toString()</code> method of the <code>Tweet</code> class, so that all of the information about a tweet is returned in an organized, printable fashion.  The string should be formatted as follows:
                                        
<pre>
date, time
retweets =  number of retweets
likes =  number of likes
text
</pre>

You should then fill in a loop in the <code>printFirstFive</code> method to loop through and print the first five tweets.  If you've done this properly, you should see the output below.  Note how they're not in any particular order.  We will address this in the next task.
                                    </p>

<h2><a name = "sorting">Part 2: Sorting By Date (6 Points)</code></a></h2>

<p>
    For the second task, you should create a comparator in the <code>Tweet</code> class to sort the tweets in ascending order of date.  Sort first by the <code>date</code> String, and if there's a tie, sort by the <code>time</code> String.  Once you've done this, use <code>Arrays.sort</code> to sort the array, and print out the first 5 tweets in order, as well as the last tweet, in the <code>printFirstFiveByDate</code> method.  If this worked properly, you should see the tweets below.  Notice how tweet 2-5 tie on the date, but they are sorted properly by time.  Noticed how the last tweet occurred last week (which is when I started creating this assignment)

                                The <code>String</code> class has a built-in comparator, so you should at some point call <code>s1.compareTo(s2)</code>, where <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> are some strings.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2><a name = "likes">Part 3: Most/Least Popular Tweets (7 Points)</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        In this part of the assignment, you should fill in the <code>getMostPopularTweet</code> method to return the tweet with the most likes.  Then, create a similar method <code>getLeastPopularTweet</code> to return the one with the least likes.  To check to make sure this works correctly, the most popular tweet should have over 350,000 likes, while the least popular one should have under 300.
                    </p>






                            <h2><a name = "words">Part 4: Most Used Words (12 Points)</code></a></h2>

                            <p>
                               In this part of the assignment, you should print out the top 200 most used words across the text of all tweets.  The easiest way to do this is to use a <code>HashMap</code> whose key is a word and whose value is the number of times that word showed up across all tweets (i.e. the "word count").  To fill in this map, loop through all of the words across all tweets (see the <a href = "#loophint">hint below</a> on how to setup such a loop).  If you've seen the word key before, change the value to be previous count plus 1.  Otherwise, if this is your first time seeing it, create an entry for the word in the map, and initialize its count to be 1.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once you're finished filling out the map, you can copy all of the information from the map over to an array.  It's easiest if you create a new class (e.g. <code>class Word</code>) with a private member variable for the word and a private member variable for the count, and then you have a comparator that sorts in decreasing order by the count.  Then, you can use <code>Arrays.sort</code> to sort the array of words.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you've done this properly and followed the hints below, then the most 200 used words, in descending order of count, should be as below.  Notice how the most used words are pretty standard filler words (the/and/to/in/of/..), but that they start to become more topical after this.

                                        <a name = "loophint">Loop Hint: </a>We want each word to be lowercase so that it gets counted as the same word regardless of capitalization.  Here's how you should start off a loop that pulls out the lowercase version of every word in every tweet, and which also takes care of empty words
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
for (int i = 0; i < tweets.length; i++) {
    String text = tweets[i].text;
    String[] words = text.split(" ");
    for (int j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
        String word = words[j];
        word = word.toLowerCase();
        if (word.length() > 0) {
            // TODO: Finish this.  Keep a running count of how many times
            // each word shows up
        }
    }
}
]]></script><BR><BR>
                                    </li>

                                        Recall that for some <code>HashMap</code> <code>map</code>HashMap</code>>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp"><![CDATA[
ArrayList<Type> keyList = new ArrayList<>(map.keySet());
]]></script>  
                                    will create an <code>ArrayList</code> that contains all of the keys in a <code>HashMap</code>.  You can use this to pull out a full "vocabulary" of all of the words used across all tweets.  Here, type is most likely <code>String</code>, since your map should have a <code>String</code> as a key and an <code>Integer</code> as a value.<BR><BR>
