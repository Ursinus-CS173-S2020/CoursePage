Part 1: Arrays And Classes
------------------
* Motivate by showing arrays in the COVID assignment
1. Make a Person class with the local variables of the arrays
2. Show how to make an array, show how printing out is null by default (fix this with dummy constructor)
3. Make static variables for states
4. Create a constructor that initializes with zero position and takes one parameter of whether they're moving or not


Coding Exercise (2 points): Make the first 10 people infected, the last 10 people uninfected



Part 2: Instance Methods
--------------------------
1. Filling in instance methods: create accessors for position/state/timeSick, create mutators makeSick(), makeBetter()
2. Create a method to initialize with random position / do random walk
3. Exercise: Create enactInfection method




Part 3: Multiple classes
--------------------------
* Move the coordinate to a class
